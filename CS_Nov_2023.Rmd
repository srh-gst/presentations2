# Motivation 

.pull-left[
- 22,112 prolonged unplanned school closures in 2011-2019, affecting over 13 million students that resulted in 91.5 million student-days lost (Jahan et al. 2022).
- 18.7% of all schools had at least one prolonged school closure ( $\geq$ 5 days). 
- Natural disasters (47%), adverse weather conditions (35%) are the most frequent reason.
- Hurricane Harvey led to >3000 schools closed in four states ranging from 1-19 days.

# Motivation

.pull-left[
- The occurrence and expenses associated with natural disasters have risen (and could continue to do so).
- Natural disaster can lead to school closures, breakdown of transit system, or even destroy school buildings and housing. 
- Potentially lasting effects on students' achievement.
- Implications for individual returns and human capital.
- Understanding the costs of natural disasters is crucial for pre- and post-disaster investment and policies.

# This Paper

**Main Question:** What are the effects of natural disasters on student achievement? 

--

## How? 

- **Data:** Combining county level student achievement (SEDA) for 2009-2018 with disaster declarations in the US from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

--

- **Framework:**  Exploit variation across US counties and years in TWFE setting 
      
  `r fontawesome::fa('long-arrow-alt-right')` Sun & Abraham DiD event study design with first year of natural disaster
      
  `r fontawesome::fa('lightbulb')` How does the effect evolve over time? Assess common trends.

--

  `r fontawesome::fa('long-arrow-alt-right')` TWFE with number or severity of natural disasters in the past five years 

  `r fontawesome::fa('lightbulb')` Are more disasters more detrimental or are counties adapting? 

--

  `r fontawesome::fa('lightbulb')`  Do larger disasters cause more harm?


---

# Data on Student Achievement

## Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA) 2009-2018 
**District and county level average achievement** (for all students and by race/ethnicity and gender), district and county level racial/ethnic and gender achievement gaps, and district level demographic/socioeconomic data.

- **Achievement is centered around zero**, so a score of zero means the county is at the average expected level of achievement within the United States. One-unit below zero means that students in the county are one grade level behind the average; one-unit above zero means that students in the county are one grade level above the average. 

`r fontawesome::fa('long-arrow-alt-right')`  Use county level and focus on grade 3.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#t <- read.table(file = "../tables/seda_summary.txt", sep = ",")
#rownames(t) <- c("Achievement All Students", "Male-Female Gap", "Non-ECD-ECD Gap", "White-Black Gap", "White-Hispanic Gap")
#t %>% head() %>%
#  knitr::kable(format = "html", align = "ccc")  
 
```

# Data on Disasters (I): FEMA

- OpenFEMA Dataset by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of the Department
of Homeland Security
- Major disaster declarations 2009-2018 (begins in 1964)
- A disaster declaration is only made (by the President of the United States) in strongly affected areas that struggle to deal with the consequences `r fontawesome::fa('long-arrow-alt-right')` rules out inconsequential natural disasters. 
- The disaster declaration includes the date the disaster was declared, the area, the type of incident, denotes which assistance program was declared. 
- Storms (73%), Floods (20%), Fire (7%), Drought (2%), Freezing, Earthquake, Landslide, Volcanic activity. 
- One disaster can cause multiple disaster events across different counties. 
- For large disasters: Information of fatalities from EM-DAT via county and start date.
- Define severe natural disasters as disasters that caused $\geq$ 25 deaths (following Bounsat et al. 2020).

# Contribution to existing literature

### Literature on school closures and absenteeism 
Covid papers eg. Werner & Woessmann (2023), teacher and student absenteeism eg. Clotfelder, Ladd, and Vigdor (2006), Miller, Murnane, and Willett (2006)

`r fontawesome::fa('long-arrow-alt-right')` Natural disaster fundamentally different from Covid. 
`r fontawesome::fa('long-arrow-alt-right')` Natural disasters can be seen as an exogenous shock to absence. 
`r fontawesome::fa('long-arrow-alt-right')` Eg. infrastructure damages are possible.

---

### Literature on specific major disasters on schools and students 
- Sacerdote (2012) for students that were forced to switch school after hurricane Katrina and Rita, there was a sharp decline in test scores in the first year after the hurricanes. Long term effects are mixed.
- Di Pietro (2019): earthquake in Italy reduced students’ probability of graduating on-time and slightly increased students’ probability of dropping out. 

`r fontawesome::fa('long-arrow-alt-right')` However, most disasters are not as severe as those outliers.
`r fontawesome::fa('long-arrow-alt-right')` Focus on young kids (grade 3).

--

- Husted, Opper, Park (2023): very similar paper (same data), focus on static effect:  

$\Delta y_{i,t} = \alpha \sum \tau_k D^k_{c,t} + \theta_t + \epsilon_{i,t}$ 

where $D^k_{c,t}$ is an indicator function of whether county c in year t is in bin k. The five bins are no, small, medium, large, very large disasters. $\Delta y_{i,t}$ is the year-to-year change in outcome. Effect on migration, average test score, and post secondary enrollment. 

---
# Model 

We're interested in the dynamic effects:  

- Problem: Staggered adoption, coefficients on lead and lag indicators in a dynamic specification can be biased with TWFE.
- Solution: reweighting following Sun and Abraham (2021)

## Target parameter 

**Cohort average treatment effect on the treated** for a treatment cohort $e$ and relative time period $l$ 

$$CATT_{e,l} = E[Y_{i,e+l} - Y^{\infty}_{i,e+l}|E_i = e]$$

$Y^{\infty}_{i,e+l}$ is the potential outcome of county $i$ in a world where it is untreated. 

Here, a treatment cohort $e$ are counties that are treated at the same time. $l$ are periods to i's initial natural disaster.

name: iw
# Dynamic Treatment effect following Sun & Abraham (2021)
Estimate the event study regression using "last treated" as control (C):

  $$Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \lambda_t + \sum_{e \notin C} \sum_{l \neq -1} CATT_{e,l}(1\{E_i =e \} \cdot D_{i,t}^l) + \epsilon_{i,t}$$
--

### The interaction weighted estimator 

Take the weighted average over all estimates for $CATT$ multiplied by the sample share of each cohort in the period $Pr(E=e)$:

$$\hat v_g = \frac{1}{|g|} \sum_{l \in g} \sum_{e} \widehat{CATT_{e,l}} \hat Pr(E_i = e| E_i \in [-l, T-l])$$
--
Main assumptions: Parallel trends for all units, Limited anticipation

# Alternative specification 

Do more disasters cause more harm?

  $$Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \lambda_t + \beta Disaster_{i,t} + \delta'(\mathbf{X}_i \lambda_t) +  \epsilon_{i,t},$$
where $Disaster_{i,t}$ is the number of natural disasters in the past 5 years in a county and year, $\alpha_i$  and $\lambda_t$ are county and year fixed effects, $\mathbf{X}_i \lambda_t$ includes an interaction between initial county population and a linear time trend. 

---
# Alternative specification 

Do larger disasters cause greater harm?


  $$Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \lambda_t + \delta_1 Minor_{i,t}^{1-5} + \delta_2 Major_{i,t}^{1-5}  + \delta'(\mathbf{X}_i \lambda_t) +  \epsilon_{i,t},$$
Following the literature, $Minor_{i,t}$ and $Major_{i,t}$ are indicators equal to 1 if the county experienced a minor or major disaster in the past five years, $\alpha_i$  and $\lambda_t$ are county and year fixed effects, $\mathbf{X}_i \lambda_t$ includes an interaction between initial county population and a linear time trend. Thus the $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$ parameters provide estimates of the impact of any type of disaster that falls into either of these two categories.

The preferred measure of a "severe" disaster is one that caused 25 or more deaths, following Boustan et al. (2020).

# Robustness and Sensitivity

- Sun and Abraham: Using never treated as [control](#nevertreated). 
- Results look similar with [Borusyak, Jaravel, and Spiess (2023)](#borus).

## Mechanism 
Human capital loss is detrimental by itself. But can we identify channels for more targeted policies?
- Out-migration?
- Mental health (open)
- Other?

# Conclusion (for now)

- What is the effect of natural disasters on students?
- Setting: Number and consts of natural disasters have been increasing, already now 80% of the unplanned school closures are due to natural disasters and adverse weather conditions.
- Evidence points to a negative effect of natural disaster on student achievement.
- More natural disasters cause more harm. This effect is larger for large natural disasters. 
- However, parts of the effect could be explained by out migration. 

Next step:
- Individual level data with effects on mental health.
