# Motivation 

- 22,112 prolonged unplanned school closures in 2011-2019, affecting over 13 million students that resulted in 91.5 million student-days lost (Jahan et al. 2022)
- Natural disasters (47%), adverse weather conditions (35%) are the most frequent reason
- Hurricane Harvey led to >3000 schools closed in four states ranging from 1-19 days

# Motivation

.pull-left[
- Frequency and costs of natural disasters have increased
- Natural disaster can lead to school closures, breakdown of transit system
- This can have lasting effects on students' achievement and future earnings
- Most studies look at impact of natural disasters on economic growth but less attention on the impact on students
- Understanding the costs of natural disasters is crucial for pre- and post-disaster investment and policies

# This Paper

- Main Question: What are the effects of natural disasters on students?
- Data: Combining county level achievement (SEDA) with FEMA disaster declarations in the US (2009-2018)
- Framework: TWFE using the first natural disaster in a county (Sun & Abraham 2021)

# Contribution to existing literature

### Literature on specific major disasters on schools and students 
Sacerdote 2012, Di Pietro 2019, Holmes 2002, Spencer et al. 2016, Shidiqi et al. 2023 
find negative short run effects on students and schools, long run effects are more mixed 

`r fontawesome::fa('long-arrow-alt-right')` However, most disasters are not as severe as those outliers

### Literature on school closures and absenteeism 
Covid papers eg. Werner & Woessmann 2023, teacher and student absenteeism eg. Clotfelder, Ladd, and Vigdor 2006, Miller, Murnane, and Willett 2006

`r fontawesome::fa('long-arrow-alt-right')` Natural disaster fundamentally different from Covid, teacher and students absence suffers from endogeneity issues

# Data on Student Achievement

## Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA) 2009-2018 
**District and county level average achievement** (for all students and by race/ethnicity and gender), district and county level racial/ethnic and gender achievement gaps, and district level demographic/socioeconomic data.

- **Achievement is centered around zero**, so a score of zero means the district is at the average expected level of achievement within the United States. One-unit below zero means that students in the district are one grade level behind the average; one-unit above zero means that students in the district are one grade level above the average. 

`r fontawesome::fa('long-arrow-alt-right')`  Use county level and focus on grade 3.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#t <- read.table(file = "../tables/seda_summary.txt", sep = ",")
#rownames(t) <- c("Achievement All Students", "Male-Female Gap", "Non-ECD-ECD Gap", "White-Black Gap", "White-Hispanic Gap")
#t %>% head() %>%
#  knitr::kable(format = "html", align = "ccc")

# Target Parameter 

- Problem: Staggered adoption, coefficients on lead and lag indicators in a dynamic specification can be biased with TWFE
- Solution: reweighting following Sun and Abraham (2021)

**Cohort average treatment effect on the treated** for a treatment cohort $e$ and relative time period $l$ 

$$CATT_{e,l} = E[Y_{i,e+l} - Y^{\infty}_{i,e+l}|E_i = e]$$

$Y^{\infty}_{i,e+l}$ is the potential outcome of county $i$ in a world where it is untreated. 

Here, a treatment cohort $e$ are counties that are treated at the same time. $l$ are periods to i's initial natural disaster.

# Dynamic Treatment effect following Sun & Abraham (2021)
Estimate the event study regression using "last treated" as control (C):

  $$Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \lambda_t + \sum_{e \notin C} \sum_{l \neq -1} CATT_{e,l}(1\{E_i =e \} \cdot D_{i,t}^l) + \epsilon_{i,t}$$
--

### The interaction weighted estimator 

Take the weighted average over all estimates for $CATT$ multiplied by the sample share of each cohort in the period $Pr(E=e)$:

$$\hat v_g = \frac{1}{|g|} \sum_{l \in g} \sum_{e} \widehat{CATT_{e,l}} \hat Pr(E_i = e| E_i \in [-l, T-l])$$

# Robustness and Sensitivity

- Using never treated as [control](#nevertreated) 
- Similar results with [Borusyak, Jaravel, and Spiess (2023)](#borus)
- No effect on [enrollment](#enrollment)

---
# Conclusion (for now)

- What is the effect of natural disasters on students?
- Setting: US where already now 80% of the prolonged unplanned school closures are due to natural disasters and adverse weather conditions
- Negative effect of natural disaster on student achievement in the year of the natural disasters
- Severe natural disasters are also more detrimental for students 
- No effect on enrollment
- Long to-do list ;)
